In a time when so many of our interactions happen online, I want to explore how these direct forms of physical contact might make a difference in our emotional well-being. To dive deeper into this, I’ve chosen to focus on how often people hug, kiss, and engage in sexual activity over the past three months as the three key variables of my study. \n",

    "I would like to create a box plot to show the relationship between the frequency of hugging in the past three months and the frequency of feeling isolated, since people's answers include different frequencies. Box plots are particularly useful for comparing distributions across multiple groups by placing them side by side. Additionally, the median line within the box allows for easy comparison of central tendencies across different groups, enabling us to make brief assumptions based on these tendencies. Moreover, box plots are efficient for large datasets, providing a clear picture without overwhelming the viewer with too much information. Apart from box plots, summary statistics also help. We can identify tendencies by calculating the mean value for different groups. However, because the isolation frequency data is categorical, we need to convert it to numerical data before creating a box plot.\n",

    "The frequency of hugs over three months is designated as the independent variable, while the frequency of feeling isolated is the dependent variable. Since both variables in linear regression must be numerical, we’ll convert the categorical data into numerical values by assigning a unique integer to each category.\n",

    "\n",
    "After performing linear regression, we’ll evaluate the model’s performance by calculating the sample correlation coefficient,r. A positive 𝑟 indicates a positive relationship between hug frequency and isolation frequency, while a negative 𝑟 suggests a negative relationship. The magnitude of 𝑟 reveals the strength of the correlation:\n",

    "4. Hypothesis and result\n",
    "I expect to see a strong negative correlation between people’s hug frequency and isolation frequency, kiss frequency and isolation frequency, and sex frequency and isolation frequency. This would suggest that a person’s degree of social isolation is inversely related to the frequency of their physical intimacy with others, such as hugging, kissing, and sexual contact. If this prediction holds true—that social isolation is related to a lack of physical contact—then we can hypothesize medically that a long-term lack of intimate contact may be one of the factors contributing to social isolation. Medical researchers could investigate this relationship further and potentially develop effective treatments. Furthermore, people might be able to reduce their risk of feeling isolated by interacting more frequently with friends, romantic partners, or family members.\n"
