Applying AI-driven assistance in coding, statistics, and data science courses do change teachers' and students' traditional ways of teaching and learning. For students, ai acts as our assistant, it finds out our coding errors, explain how complex codes work, introduce new coding methods, and answer our questions anytime. Before introducing AI-driven assistance to class, if students have problems, usually they seach on google or ask teachers. However, the message given by google is messy and sometimes unreliable, and teachers' energy is limited. Contrast to google and teacher, Chatbot gives more accurate messages and never feels tired, students can get answers anytime. \n",
